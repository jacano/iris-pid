This work is about localization of iris in gray scale images.
We used the following article as our main reference: Localization of iris in gray scale images using intensity gradient (A. Basit, M.Y. Javed).

The process of iris localization is divided in four stages: pupil localization, iris outer boundary detection, eyelids localization and eyelashes removal.

In the first stage we begin by applying a mean filter to the input image in order to soften it. Next, we apply a threshold filter to ease the localization of a point (any point) belonging to the pupil.
Once that is done, we proceed to calculate the center and radius of the pupil.

In the second phase the outer boundary of the iris is located. In order to do that we first apply a Gauss filter to the image and calculate the points with significant intensity gradient in a band around where we think the iris/sclera boundary must be.

In the third phase we proceed to locate eyelids, which may occlude part of the iris region that was calculated on the previous phase.
In order to do this we look for points with significant intensity gradient inside the iris region.

In the last phase we remove the eyelashes (if any) that may still be occluding part of the iris.
